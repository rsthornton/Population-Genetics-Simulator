# BERT-Population Genetics Simulator Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a plan to demonstrate the integration between BERT (Bounded Entity Reasoning Toolkit) and the Population Genetics Simulator. The goal is to create a simple proof-of-concept showing how BERT can be used to model and configure a population genetics simulation.

## System Structure in BERT

We will create a BERT model with the following structure:

### Main System
- **Population Genetics System**: The entire simulated ecosystem

### Sources
- **Environment**: Provides selection pressure and target values
- **Gene Pool**: Provides genetic variation

### Subsystems
- **Population**: Collection of organisms with distribution of phenotypes
- **Selection Mechanism**: Determines fitness based on environment
- **Reproduction**: Handles creation of new organisms

### Interfaces
- **Environmental Input Interface**: Where environment target values enter the system
- **Reproduction Output Interface**: Where new organisms emerge
- **Selection Interface**: Where environmental pressure affects fitness

### Sinks
- **Eliminated Organisms**: Organisms that don't survive
- **Population Data**: Metrics collected from the simulation

### Flows
- **Environmental Pressure Flow**: From Environment to Selection Interface
- **Selection Flow**: From Selection Interface to Population
- **Reproduction Flow**: From Population to Reproduction Output Interface
- **Genetic Variation Flow**: From Gene Pool to Reproduction

## Mapping to JavaScript Simulation

The BERT model maps directly to specific elements in the JavaScript simulation:

### BERT Component → JavaScript Implementation

#### Main System
- **Population Genetics System** → `Automata` class in `automata.js`
  - Contains the entire simulation environment and controls generation progression

#### Sources
- **Environment** → Environmental parameters in `params.js` and target generation in `automata.js`
  - Maps to `targetDynamics`, `environmentPattern`, and `environmentDynamics` in the simulation
  - Controlled by initialization logic in `initializeAutomata()` method

- **Gene Pool** → Initial gene creation logic in `RealGene` constructor
  - Maps to the initial variation parameters that seed the genetic diversity
  - Implemented in `gene.js` and controlled by `PARAMS.initialVariation`

#### Subsystems
- **Population** → `Population` class in `population.js`
  - Directly corresponds to the population grid cells in the simulation
  - Manages collections of organisms and their interactions

- **Selection Mechanism** → Selection logic in `population.js`
  - Implemented in the `nextGeneration()` method
  - Uses the distance between phenotype and target to calculate fitness
  - Controlled by `PARAMS.reproductionVariance` (fitness function width)

- **Reproduction** → Reproduction logic in `population.js`
  - Implemented in the offspring generation sections of `nextGeneration()`
  - Creates new organisms based on parent genetics and mutation

#### Interfaces
- **Environmental Input Interface** → `currentTarget()` method in `population.js`
  - Where environmental values are passed to the population for selection

- **Selection Interface** → Fitness calculation in `nextGeneration()`
  - The specific calculation: `expectedOffspring = maxOffspring * Math.pow(Math.E, -distance / variance)`

- **Reproduction Output Interface** → Offspring creation code in `nextGeneration()`
  - Where new organisms are instantiated and added to populations

#### Sinks
- **Eliminated Organisms** → Mortality logic in `nextGeneration()`
  - Implemented via `Math.random() >= PARAMS.deathChancePerGeneration`

- **Population Data** → `DataManager` class in `datamanager.js`
  - Collects, processes, and visualizes population statistics

#### Flows
- **Environmental Pressure Flow** → Target value propagation to fitness calculation
  - How environment influences selection through the target value

- **Selection Flow** → How fitness determines number of offspring
  - The mathematical relationship between phenotype-target distance and reproduction

- **Reproduction Flow** → Creation and addition of new organisms to the population
  - Including both the deterministic and probabilistic components

- **Genetic Variation Flow** → Mutation logic in `organism.js` and `gene.js`
  - Controlled by `PARAMS.mutationRate` and `PARAMS.mutationRange`

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: BERT Model Creation
1. Create the system structure in BERT manually
2. Add parameters to components (e.g., mutation rate, selection pressure)
3. Export the BERT model as JSON

### Phase 2: Python Translator Development
1. Create a Python script that:
   - Parses the BERT JSON output
   - Extracts key parameters and structure
   - Generates a configuration for the JavaScript simulation
   - Key parameters for initial demo:
     - Mutation rate
     - Population size
     - Selection strength
     - Environment pattern
     - Environment dynamics

### Phase 3: JavaScript Simulation Integration
1. Use the generated configuration to initialize the simulation
2. Run the simulation with the BERT-derived parameters
3. Visualize the results using the existing simulation interface

### Phase 4: Documentation and Demonstration
1. Document the workflow from BERT to simulation
2. Demonstrate how changes in the BERT model affect simulation outcomes
3. Create a simple guide for others to replicate the demonstration

## Success Criteria

The demonstration will be considered successful if:
1. A BERT model can be created that conceptually represents the population genetics system
2. The Python translator can extract key parameters from the BERT JSON
3. The JavaScript simulation can be configured using the translator output
4. Changes in the BERT model result in observable changes in the simulation

## Value of This Integration

This integration between BERT and the Population Genetics Simulator provides several significant benefits:

### Educational Impact
- **Conceptual Clarity**: BERT's visual system modeling makes complex evolutionary dynamics more accessible to students and non-specialists
- **Mental Model Building**: Students can first understand system components and relationships visually before diving into the mathematical details
- **Parameter Exploration**: The integration enables intuitive exploration of how changing system parameters affects evolutionary outcomes

### Research Benefits
- **Design-First Approach**: Promotes thoughtful system modeling before implementation, leading to better-designed simulations
- **Communication Tool**: Provides researchers a standardized way to communicate complex simulation designs to collaborators and in publications
- **Interdisciplinary Bridge**: Creates common ground between theoretical biologists and computational scientists

### Technical Advantages
- **Complementary Tools**: Combines BERT's system decomposition capabilities with the simulation's computational engine
- **Structured Modeling**: The BERT-to-simulation workflow encourages more structured and documented model development
- **Reproducibility**: Parameter configurations can be saved, shared, and precisely replicated

### Broader Impact
- **Conceptual-Computational Bridge**: Demonstrates how visual system models can be linked to functional simulations
- **Template for Integration**: Provides a pattern that could be applied to other complex adaptive systems (ecological, social, economic)
- **Accessibility**: Makes computational evolutionary biology more accessible to researchers from diverse backgrounds

## Future Extensions

After the initial demonstration, potential extensions include:
1. Expanding the parameter set translated from BERT to simulation
2. Creating a more detailed BERT template specific to population genetics
3. Adding bidirectional communication to feed simulation results back to BERT
4. Creating a web-based interface that integrates both tools
